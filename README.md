# LeetCode WS

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems, primarily implemented in TypeScript and Rust. The legacy Go solutions are kept for historical reference but are no longer actively maintained.

MD Version: [CN](./README.zh-CN.md) | [EN](./README.md)

## Repository Structure

```

```

## Languages Used

- **Primary Languages**: TypeScript, Rust
- **Deprecated**: Go (kept for reference only, not actively updated)

## Solution Format

Each solution file is named using the following format:
`[problem-number].[problem-name].[language-extension]`

For example:
- `88.merge-sorted-array.go`
- `3405.count-the-number-of-arrays-with-k-matching-adjacent-elements.ts`
- `2110.number-of-smooth-descent-periods-of-a-stock.rs`
